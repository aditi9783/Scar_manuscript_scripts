# Scar_manuscript_scripts
Scripts for analyses of scar data and data visualization, identifying evolutionarily independent isolates, and enumerating population level unique scar occurrences

1. Scripts in data_analysis do statistical tests of meta data generated from genomic data, and for visualizing the results.

2. Scripts in evol_indep_isolates generate a list of isolates from a phylogenetic tree (in newick format) that are evolutionarily independent.

3. Scripts in indep_scar_events count the number of scar clades in phylogenetic trees in newick format.
